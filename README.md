# Evangelion-Übersicht-Widget

## About
This widget is an Evangelion Übersicht Widget, displaying information through a huge amount of cells on your desktop.

If you leaves nothing on your desktop except for less than six mounted volumes (system volumes, connected servers etc.), this widget can replace your desktop completely.

The interface is now MULTI-LANGUAGE! Supported language:
* Deutsch
* English
* 繁體中文

Currently with this widget you can:

1. View time
2. Check CPU and memory usage (Memory usage here includes cache usage, so it might come over 100%)
3. Check battery status
4. Check you Trash size
5. Check your public ip address
6. Control your iTunes, show current artist and title
7. Show first 5 of all your mounted volumes in alphabetical order

Special features
* Alarm system, triggers when CPU usage is too high or battery drops to below 20% without charging
* Empty your trash bin by clicking the trash cell
* Open up a volume by clicking it
